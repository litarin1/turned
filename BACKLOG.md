# TODO:
#### Rendering
- dynamic window size
#### Inputs
- mouse input
- dynamic keys mapping
- get rid of GLFW, because it does not respects keyboard remapping, (mainly caps:escape xkb option)

## (My own priority):
#### Rendering
1 Predictable zoom and dynamic window size
3 Try to decrease the input-lag by rendering everything on a framebuffer and then rotating in by mouse movement in a separate no-GPU thread\
#### unrelated
2 Movement
