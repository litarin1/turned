# TODO:
#### Rendering
- dynamic window size
#### Inputs
- mouse input
- dynamic keys mapping
- get rid of GLFW, because it does not respects keyboard remapping, (mainly caps:escape xkb option)

## (My own priority):
#### Rendering
1 Model-View-Projection matrix\
2 Sprites\
4 Try to decrease the input-lag by rendering everything on a framebuffer and then rotating in by mouse movement in a separate no-GPU thread\
#### unrelated
3 Movement
